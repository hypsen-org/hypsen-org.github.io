      <description>Screen To replace two aging 14&amp;quot; &amp;ldquo;flat&amp;rdquo; screens with poor contrast and black depth, I was looking for a single screen with the following specs:
VA panel1 [guide] static contrast of 2500:1 or more [guide] curved about 34&amp;quot; After reading some online comparisons, I restricted my selection to:
the Huawei Mateview GT 34&amp;quot; brightness: 350 cd/m² static contrast: 4000:1 resolution: 3440 x 1440 the Samsung Odyssey G5 32&amp;quot;. brightness: 300 cd/m² static contrast: 2500:1 resolution: 2560 x 1440 The final decision, in favor of the Huawei, was based on contrast, resolution and the opportunity to get it while on sale.</description>

      <description>The opticians with whom I talk about my situation explain that it is sometimes possible to produce lenses that are both:
suitable for sight, to correct myopia, hypermetropia, astygmatism, for example shaded, to protect against glare curved to reduce side glare polarizing, to increase contrast It seems that the weaker the correction, the thinner the lenses will be and the more it will be possible to bend, shade, polarize them, etc.</description>

      <description>In addition to glasses, wearing a hat or a cap simply but effectively limits glare from high sources (clear sky, sun, neon lights from shops, etc.). If I have been wearing for years, and to my wife&amp;rsquo;s dismay, a quite banal cap, there are caps specifically designed for wearing &amp;ldquo;invasive&amp;rdquo; glasses:

      <title>Hypersensitivity to light</title>

      <description>Motivation I am hypersensitive to light. Here I share some measures and equipment that help me to live as normal a daily life as possible. If you or someone close to you is going through the same situation, I hope these few lines will be useful to you.
Context In May 2023, I had an autoimmune reaction which temporarily rendered me completely blind. Fortunately, I was remarkably taken care of by the teams in CHUV and the Hôpital Ophthalmique Jules Gonin in Lausanne.</description>

      <title>Linux in dark mode</title>

      <description>I moved from Windows to Linux more than ten years ago. I am now using Xubuntu, which I am extremely satisfied with. With some computer knowledge, Linux makes it possible to customize just about any detail of the user experience, especially the look and feel. This is particularly useful when living with a visual impairment, since it is easy to go from this&amp;hellip;
&amp;hellip; to this &amp;hellip;
This page outlines the customizations I have made to my desktop environment to help me better withstand exposure to computer screens despite my hypersensitivity to light.</description>

      <description>Hypersensitivity to light makes white texts on a black backgrounds extremely appreciable, even essential. So here are the references I&amp;rsquo;m currently using for writing white on black:
Notebook and pens Notebook of 200 black pages Black Paper Notebook, to my knowledge not found in physical stores, White ink pens Gelly Roll by Sakura, discovered in a local store that sells them cheaper than online. Slate and chalk pencils An alternative to notebooks is using a slate with chalk pencils.</description>

      <description>This page outlines the sunglasses selection process I went through due to my sudden hypersensitivity to light.
Being hypersensitive to light, wearing proper sunglasses has dramatically improved my quality of life. From my discussions with therapists and specialized opticians, the choice of glasses capable of relieving hypersensitivity is based on the following criteria:
The shade of the lenses, more or less dark The polarization of the lenses The geometry of the frame: curvature and thickness of the temples Lens shade Glare and UV protections A distinction must be made between protection against glare and protection against ultraviolet rays.</description>

      <description>This page presents the watch I selected after my sudden hypersensitivity to light.
Being often dazzled outdoors and also having difficulty distinguishing low contrasts, I had to put aside the watch that had accompanied me for many years. I replaced it with a watch with an AMOLED screen whose main advantage is to display both deep blacks and intense colors. These elements allow an important contrast and comfortable reading even in direct sunlight.</description>

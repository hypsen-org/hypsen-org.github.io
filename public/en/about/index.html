<p>I became <a href="https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#light-and-glare-sensitivity">hyper-sensitive to light</a> in May 2023, following an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminate_encephalomyelitis">auto-immune reaction</a> which made me totally blind for a few days. Fortunately, I was remarkably taken care of by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_University_Hospital">CHUV</a> teams in Lausanne and less than two months after the end of the treatment, I had recovered most of the <a href="https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html">sensory abilities</a> that constitute vision:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>visual acuity</strong> (the famous &ldquo;10/10 for each eye&rdquo;),</li>
<li>the <strong>visual field</strong>,</li>
<li>the <strong>perception of colors</strong>, starting with yellow and blue and therefore letting red come last, which is not without irony for a Swiss resident.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, only my <strong>sensitivity to light</strong> and my <strong>sensitivity to weak contrasts</strong> are still deficient. Concretely, I am much more easily dazzled than before by light or saturated colors (neon lights in stores, for example).</p>

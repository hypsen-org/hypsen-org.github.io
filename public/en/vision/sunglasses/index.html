                <p>This page outlines the sunglasses selection process I went through due to my sudden <a href="..">hyper-sensitivity to light</a>.</p>
<p>Being hyper-sensitive to light, wearing proper sunglasses has dramatically improved my quality of life. From my discussions with therapists and specialized opticians, the choice of glasses capable of relieving hyper-sensitivity is based on the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
<li>The shade of the lenses, more or less dark</li>
<li>The polarization of the lenses</li>
<li>The geometry of the frame: curvature and thickness of the temples</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="lens-shade">Lens shade</h2>
<h3 id="glare-and-uv-protections">Glare and UV protections</h3>
<p>A distinction must be made between protection against glare and protection against ultraviolet rays. By definition, <strong>glare is caused by visible light</strong>. Glare protection requires shaded glasses. On the contrary, <strong>ultraviolet rays are invisible</strong>, since they correspond by definition to the light spectrum beyond violet, which is the most intense color perceptible to the human eye. Protecting yourself from UV involves applying another kind of treatment to the lenses. This treatment may be invisible.</p>
<p><img src="/vision/visible-light-spectrum.png" alt="Light spectrum&quot;"></p>
<p>In summary, very dark lenses are very effective against glare but will not necessarily protect against UV. Conversely, clear UV-treated lenses may filter 100% solar UV but will not protect against glare at all.</p>
<p>This section deals only with glare protection. This is codified by <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0425">a text of European law</a>. A number from 0 to 4 indicating the degree of protection against glare is indicated in the description of each pair of sunglasses [[source](https://www.visilab.ch/fr/votre-vision/verres- solar)]. Categories 3 and 4 are the most interesting in case of hyper-sensitivity to light.</p>
<h3 id="category-0">Category 0</h3>
<p><strong>These lenses filter between 0% and 20% of the light</strong>. These are generally glasses for aesthetic purposes. They do not provide effective protection in the event of exposure to strong sunlight.</p>
<h3 id="category-1">Category 1</h3>
<p><strong>These lenses filter between 20% and 57% of the light</strong>. They are recommended for situations with attenuated sunshine, such as for example in winter or in very gray weather. This index is not recommended for massive exposure to strong sunlight.</p>
<h3 id="category-2">Category 2</h3>
<p><strong>These lenses filter between 57% and 82% of the light</strong>. They are recommended for situations with average sunshine.</p>
<h3 id="category-3">Category 3</h3>
<p><strong>These lenses filter between 82% and 92% of the light</strong>. They are effective in situations of strong light: at the sea, at the beach, or for winter sports.</p>
<h3 id="category-4">Category 4</h3>
<p><strong>These lenses filter more than 92% of light</strong>. They are indicated in case of extreme luminosity such as for mountaineering on glaciers or in high mountains because the luminosity is increased tenfold by the reverberation on ice and snow.</p>
<p>Please note: some countries prohibit driving while wearing category 4 glasses.</p>
<h2 id="lens-color">Lens color</h2>
<p>Gray shaded lenses will reduce the perceived brightness without altering the colors.</p>
<p>On the contrary, blue, brown or any other color glasses will modify the perception of colors.</p>
<h2 id="lens-polarization">Lens polarization</h2>
<p>Polarizing lenses help improve contrast. The Wikipedia page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_(physics)#Applications_and_examples">Polarization_(optics)</a> explains this phenomenon.</p>
<h2 id="frame">Frame</h2>
<p>In order to limit glare from light sources located at the periphery of the visual field, it is recommended to choose arched frames with thick temples, or even side panels to limit glare from the side.</p>
<h2 id="personal-selection">Personal selection</h2>
<p>Given my current sensitivity to light, I most often wear category 4 polarizing lenses outdoors and category 3 non-polarizing lenses indoors. When I can fully control the brightness of my environment, such as the room that I use as my telecommuting office, I can even put on my old non-tinted and non-polarizing glasses.</p>
<h2 id="references">References</h2>
<p>All the references below filter 100% of harmful UV rays (manufacturer data).</p>
<p>You will see that I took all my glasses from Decathlon. This is due to the following reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It is possible to try the products and, if they are not suitable, to return them for exchange or refund, for 30 days and up to 1 year <a href="https://www.decathlon.ch/fr/landing/365-jours-retour/_/R-a-a140016v">under conditions</a>.</li>
<li>I have been wearing one of their models of cycling sunglasses for a long time and with satisfaction (see below).</li>
<li>There is a store near me choice :)</li>
</ol>
<p>As I hope my vision will continue to improve, point 1 above will allow me to swap out my glasses, if needed, as I progress.</p>
<h3 id="category-4-polarizing-or-not">Category 4 polarizing or not</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.decathlon.ch/fr/p/lunettes-de-soleil-randonnee-mh590-adulte-polarisantes-categorie-4/_/R-p-181313?mc=8548667">Decathlon Quechua MH590</a></p>
<p>These arched glasses have gray lenses and very wide temples that do not allow any side light to pass through. They also exist in a non-polarizing version. Since the frame of the glasses is very close to the face, it passes well under the visor of my cap, which is not the case with all category 3 or 4 glasses.</p>
<p><img src="/vision/MH-590.png" alt="Quechua MH-590 Decathlon sunglasses"></p>
<h3 id="category-3-non-polarizing">Category 3 non-polarizing</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.decathlon.ch/fr/p/lunettes-de-velo-adulte-roadr-500-categorie-3-noires/_/R-p-181317?mc=8405401">Decathlon Van Rysel Roadr 500</a></p>
<p>I already had these glasses before my vision loss. Blue in color, the lenses alter the colors. Although I now use them in a completely different context, they are arched enough to filter light from all directions. Unfortunately, these glasses do not exist in a polarizing version. Moreover, Van Rysel glasses are designed with a frame not quite as close to the forehead as the Quechua. This is not a problem with a helmet for cycling, which is the intended use for this model. It is more problematic with a cap, since the glasses prevent the visor from &ldquo;falling&rdquo; properly into place.</p>
<p><img src="/vision/Roadr-500.png" alt="Van Rysel Roadr500 Decathlon sunglasses"></p>
<h3 id="category-3-polarizing">Category 3 polarizing</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.decathlon.ch/fr/p/lunettes-de-soleil-polarisees-flottantes-voile-adulte-500-taille-m-petrole/_/R-p-325360">Decathlon Tribord 500</a></p>
<p>Less curved and with narrower temples, these blue-tinted glasses are a little less protective than previous models. However, they remain a perfectly suitable choice for my use.</p>

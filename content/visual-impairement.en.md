This document is an excerpt from [the low vision accessibility page](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#visual-impairments) authored by [W3C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium).

The following section briefly introduces five types of visual impairments.

## Visual Acuity (Clarity)

Visual acuity is the clarity or sharpness of vision. It relates to the finest detail a person can perceive. It is generally dependent on the functioning of the retina part of the eye and of the interpretation of the brain. Measurement of distance visual acuity is based on a standard of 20/20 (6/6 in metric).

Some low visual acuity can be corrected with glasses, contact lenses, or surgery – and some cannot. Therefore, some people will not see small text or fine details at all.

## Light and Glare Sensitivity

Many people with low vision have extreme sensitivity to light (called photophobia). Bright light makes it difficult or impossible to see, and causes eye pain and headaches. For some people, the normal brightness of a computer screen with a light background is not readable and painful. They need to change the background to a darker color. Glare sensitivity is common with age-related vision changes and cataracts.

### Simulated Examples of Light Sensitivity
The images below are not from the W3C site. They were (awkwardly) created by me to illustrate the glare I experience in common situations.

## Contrast Sensitivity

Contrast sensitivity is the ability to detect differences in brightness, for example, to discern text from its background. A common accessibility barrier for people with low contrast sensitivity is gray text on a light background.

Contrast is based on brightness. Colors that look very different (for example, red, blue, green) can have similar brightness, and not provide sufficient contrast. [Tools](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/visual-audio-contrast7.html#visual-audio-contrast7-resources-head) are available to determine the contrast ratio between colors.

## Field of Vision

Field of vision, or visual field, is the entire area that can be seen when the eye is directed forward, including what is seen with peripheral vision. Some eye and neurological conditions cause field loss, where people have a smaller or obscured field of vision. For example, significant peripheral field loss, sometimes called "tunnel vision", is somewhat like looking through a drinking straw.

Types of visual field loss can be grouped as follows:

* Peripheral field loss: People only see in the central portion of their visual field.
* Central field loss: Vision is reduced or absent in the middle of people’s vision.
* Other field loss: People have scattered patches of obscured vision, have a ring of field loss, have field loss in the left or right part of their vision, or other field loss.

## Color Vision

Some people do not see certain colors well or at all. Color vision deficiencies are commonly called “color blindness”, even though most people who are color blind can see many colors. It is rare that a person cannot see any color at all. Globally, approximately 1 in 12 men (8%) and 1 in 200 women have color vision deficiencies. Color vision deficiencies are not classified as “low vision” or disabilities in many contexts.

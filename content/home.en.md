This site is dedicated to hyper-sensitivity to light.

At the moment, it contains the following sections:

* Illustrations and specificities of various forms of visual impairment: [here](../visual-impairments)
* My journey since I became hyper-sensitive to light: [here](../about)
* How I adapted my environment: [there](../adaptation)

I hope you'll find this site useful.

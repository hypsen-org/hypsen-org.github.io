## Motivation
I am [hypersensitive to light](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#light-and-glare-sensitivity). Here I share some measures and equipment that help me to live as normal a daily life as possible. If you or someone close to you is going through the same situation, I hope these few lines will be useful to you.

## Context
In May 2023, I had an [autoimmune reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis) which temporarily rendered me completely blind. Fortunately, I was remarkably taken care of by the teams in [CHUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_University_Hospital) and the [HÃ´pital Ophthalmique Jules Gonin](https://www.ophtalmique.ch/) in Lausanne. Less than two months after the end of the treatment, I had recovered most of the [sensory abilities](https://w3c.github.io/low-vision-a11y-tf/requirements.html#visual-impairments) that constitute vision:
* **visual acuity** (the famous "10/10 for each eye"),
* the **visual field**,
* the **perception of colors**, starting with yellow and blue and therefore letting red come last, which is not without irony for a Swiss resident.

Today, only my **sensitivity to light** and **sensitivity to low contrasts** are still deficient. Concretely, I am much more easily dazzled than before by white, clear objects and saturated colors (the neon lights of stores, for example). Poor light management also makes it harder for me to spot tone-on-tone objects, such as my black phone on a black surface.

## Examples
### Glare
The images below illustrate (awkwardly) the glare felt in certain situations.

When reading a text printed in black on a white background:
* on the left: page perceived with "normal" vision
* on the right: the same page perceived with hypersensitivity to light and in the absence of glasses

In a normally lit environment:
* top: scene perceived with "normal" vision
* bottom: the same scene perceived with hypersensitivity to light and in the absence of glasses

### Low contrasts
The image below illustrates how low contrasts appear due to light sensitivity.
To make my life easier, I put self-adhesive neon strips on most of the objects that I have trouble spotting.

Where possible, I include a link to the products or software I mention. I get no benefit of any kind from it. I do this only to unequivocally identify what I am talking about, in case a reader wants to know more.

Finally, unless otherwise stated, I myself use the references mentioned.

## Introduction
This section presents the various elements I have adapted to live almost normally with [light hhyper-sensitivity](../adaptation/visual-impairments/#light-and-glare-sensitivity).

To give you an idea of the nature and intensity of my sensitivity, and measure whether my condition is similar to yours or not, I prepared some examples below.

## Examples
### Glare
The images below illustrate (awkwardly) the glare felt in certain situations.

When reading a text printed in black on a white background:
* on the left: page perceived with "normal" vision
* on the right: the same page perceived with hhyper-sensitivity to light and in the absence of glasses

In a normally lit environment:
* top: scene perceived with "normal" vision
* bottom: the same scene perceived with hhyper-sensitivity to light and in the absence of glasses

### Low contrasts
The image below illustrates how low contrasts appear due to light sensitivity.
To make my life easier, I put self-adhesive neon strips on most of the objects that I have trouble spotting.

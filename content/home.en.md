This site is dedicated to hyper-sensitivity to light.

At the moment, it contains the following sections:

* [Illustrations](../visual-impairments) of hyper-sensitivity and other forms of visual impairment
* A [timeline](../about) of events since I became hyper-sensitive to light
* The [main adaptations](../adaptation) I did to my environment

I hope you'll find this site useful.

This page presents the watch I selected after my sudden hyper-sensitivity to light.

Being often dazzled outdoors and also having difficulty distinguishing low contrasts, I had to put aside the watch that had accompanied me for many years. I replaced it with a watch with an [AMOLED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLED) screen whose main advantage is to display both deep blacks and intense colors. These elements allow an important contrast and comfortable reading even in direct sunlight.

My choice fell on the [Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 Classic](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-watch4-classic/specs/) which is already an old model. It can therefore be found in promotion while still being officially sold and supported by Samsung. Using it to display the time, my calendar and the number of steps taken during the day, the battery lasts two days or more. I also like how easy it is to customize the screen. It took me less than 10 minutes to modify one of the pre-installed dial templates, change it to white text on a black background and replace some useless information with more useful widgets (a second time zone, in my case).

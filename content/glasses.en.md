The opticians with whom I talk about my situation explain that it is sometimes possible to produce lenses that are both:
* suitable for sight, to correct myopia, hypermetropia, astygmatism, for example
* shaded, to protect against glare
* curved to reduce side glare
* polarizing, to increase contrast

It seems that the weaker the correction, the thinner the lenses will be and the more it will be possible to bend, shade, polarize them, etc.

Conversely, the greater the correction, the thicker the lenses and the more difficult it will be to satisfy the constraints of strong curvature, dark shade and polarization.

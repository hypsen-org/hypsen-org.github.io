## Personal background
I became [hyper-sensitive to light](../adaptation/visual-impairments/#light-and-glare-sensitivity) in May 2023, following an [auto-immune reaction](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/acute-disseminated-encephalomyelitis#:~:text=Acute%20disseminated%20encephalomyelitis%20(ADEM)%20is,spinal%20cord%20that%20damages%20myelin.) which made me totally blind for a few days. Fortunately, I was remarkably taken care of by the [CHUV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lausanne_University_Hospital) teams in Lausanne and less than two months after the end of the treatment, I had recovered most of the [sensory abilities](../adaptation/visual-impairments) that constitute vision:
* **visual acuity** (the famous "10/10 for each eye"),
* the **visual field**,
* the **perception of colors**, starting with yellow and blue and therefore letting red come last, which is not without irony for a Swiss resident.

Today, only my **sensitivity to light** and my **sensitivity to weak contrasts** are still (extremely) deficient. Concretely, I am much more easily dazzled than before by light or saturated colors (natural sunlight, neon lights in stores, for example).

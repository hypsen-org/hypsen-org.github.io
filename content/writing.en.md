hyper-sensitivity to light makes white texts on a black backgrounds extremely appreciable, even essential. So here are the references I'm currently using for writing white on black:

## Notebook and pens
- Notebook of 200 black pages [Black Paper Notebook](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0C1HWZ7N1), to my knowledge not found in physical stores,
- White ink pens [Gelly Roll by Sakura](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B07DN9KRCJ), discovered in a local store that sells them cheaper than online.

## Slate and chalk pencils
An alternative to notebooks is using a [slate](https://www.jumbo.ch/fr/sejour-eclairage/accessoires-d-interieur/panneaux-d-affichage-tapis/ardoise-murale-woody/p/5996775) with [chalk pencils](https://www.jumbo.ch/fr/sejour-eclairage/papeterie/fournituresappareils-de-bureau/divers/3-craies-pour-jeux-de-carte/p/4210167). The pencils can be found in the games and toys section of many stores, as these pencils are used by card players to keep score.

## Electronic reader with note taking
There are more and more e-readers allowing not only to read but also to take notes in dark mode. I hesitated between the following three references:
- Kindle Scribe ([link](https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B09BSQ365J))
- Kobo Elipsa 2E ([link](https://www.kobo.com/media-hub/kobo-elipsa-2e))
- Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C ([link](https://onyxboox.com/boox_taultrac))

I finally chose the Kindle Scribe for entirely personal reasons: I was already familiar with Kindle products, whereas I was unable to try the Kobo Elipsa 2E or the Tab Ultra C. Moreover, my previous e-reader being a Kindle Paperwhite, my library was already largely compatible with the Kindle ecosystem. In addition, I was still very satisfied with this e-reader which I had nevertheless used intensively since 2015, its only fault in my (new) eyes being that it did not offer reading in dark mode. Finally, the Scribe was on sale when I was doing my market research; it thus offered him a value for money that was certainly temporary but which ended up convincing me.

My main gripes with the Kindle Scribe are:
1. the poor choice of protective cases, especially at affordable prices,
2. the impossibility, which I hope will be temporary, of synchronizing my notes with Google Drive.

Having been unable to test the Kobo Elipsa 2E nor the Onyx Boox Tab Ultra C, I am unfortunately unable to comment on their respective advantages and disadvantages, beyond what I have read on the internet.

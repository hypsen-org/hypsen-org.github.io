*Last updated: April 2024*

This page describes in a romanced way the events that occurred from the total loss of vision that affected me in May 2023, up to the most recent progress.

I was very fortunate to be able to recover [three of the five faculties that constitute vision](../about). I owe this largely to my family and the medical teams at CHUV who remarkably supported me through this ordeal.

I hope that their optimism, kindness, and, dare I say, lightness, which helped me stay positive, will be evident below.

## D-Day Minus 1: Back from the hospital
In 2023, my son graciously passed on to me a pneumonia he was dealing with, with only a mild cough and the characteristic carelessness of short-pants-wearing germ sponges. Fortunately for him, he overcame his own infection without any complications. My pneumonia, however, was much more stubborn, even sending me to the hospital for a week.

Back home, I was able to spend a quiet evening and then went to bed normally. But the next morning, upon waking, I was almost blind.

## D-Day Morning: No Panic
My room was just a superposition of dazzling and blurry spots: the shelves were reduced to large rectangles barely distinguishable from the walls, the alarm clock on my bedside table was a barely recognizable cube. Despite everything, I managed to navigate the space, I suppose, like Vincent Van Gogh after a hangover.

My first reaction was to think: "So this is what an [ocular migraine](https://www.aoa.org/healthy-eyes/eye-and-vision-conditions/ocular-migraine) is". I had heard about this type of migraine during my studies, through a friend who suffered from them regularly. I didn't know the exact symptoms, but since I had just come out of the hospital the day before, after a week that had shaken me up badly, I found this explanation all the more satisfying as I knew nothing about it.

So I calmly informed my wife, with the serenity of a fool who, having no medical training, self-diagnoses based on outdated memories of a disease he never had and thus completely underestimates the severity of the situation:

-- Honey, did you sleep well? I’ve gone blind. I must be having an ocular migraine. I’ll take a shower, get dressed, then you’ll have to take me to the emergency room. Have the kids had their breakfast?

## D-Day Noon: What light?
The reception at the emergency room brought me back to reality in two steps.

First, my vision had quickly deteriorated, and even for a medical simpleton like me, my symptoms no longer matched a migraine, ocular or not.

Moreover, the emergency doctors did not like our first exchange at all:

-- Hello, I’d like you to follow this light with your eyes.

-- Sure. What light?

A long perplexed and worrying silence followed.

Fortunately, the emergency doctor never stays perplexed or worrying for long. I was quickly sent for all sorts of tests, from the most barbaric to the most sophisticated[^1].

After that intense first night, I only remember that by morning my visual acuity was less than 1/10. In other words, I was legally blind.

## Day 1 and beyond: It’s going to sting
Fortunately, it is now proven that medical training produces doctors less idiotic than their patients. Based on the initial tests, the teams surrounding me had the good sense to suspect inflammation of the central nervous system and the optic nerve.

I was then admitted to the neurology department where I was injected with equine doses of intravenous corticosteroids; as a result, I began to devour my meals with the appetite of a Swiss wrestler on a raclette night; consequently (bis), I imagined becoming blind and obese in the same week[^2].

## Day 4 or 5 or 6; anyway, it was long.
The first good news was that the anti-inflammatories stabilized my blindness. I could even follow the light when asked and detect that there was a poster stuck on the wardrobe next to my bed, which no one asked me to do, but I’m telling you anyway.

Visual acuity: around 1/10 and grayscale vision. It sounds meh, but it was much better than the single-level white vision I had known until then.

## Day 10 to Day 15: "Plasma is people"
I admit I no longer remember the timelines at all. Nevertheless, once the results of the last tests arrived, and since the effects of cortisone were stagnating at too low a level to make it the sole treatment due to side effects, I was sent to the dialysis department for a ~~linguistic~~ [plasma exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis).

At this point in the story, the doctors hypothesized that my immune system had gone haywire fighting the pneumonia and was attacking the central nervous system: brain, optic nerve, spinal cord. To stop this autoimmune sabotage, my veins had to be purged of the crazy antibodies swarming in them.

In concrete terms, I was left lying down between three and four hours a day, five days in a row, on an inclined bed listening to Roland Garros on TV[^3] while individuals in white coats replaced my blood with that of anonymous volunteers.

Since you bring it up, let me submit a mystery that my hours of reflection in a semi-vegetative state have failed to solve. How can we claim that a donor is both voluntary and anonymous, since anonymity precisely prevents us from finding those who we would like to verify were voluntary yesterday? Are we trying to appease the doubts produced in some paranoid hospitalized patients like me by an ultra-violent literary and TV culture where men of my age and build are regularly butchered in torrents of hemoglobin[^4]? Why, in horror movies, do little bald potbellied men always get it first?

These questions posed, I must admit that my dialyzers were particularly non-violent. Their care restored my visual acuity and color perception with a methodical patience that only Swiss watchmaking and tax administration are capable of today: I thus regained colors one hue at a time.

First came yellow, the most totally useless color in a hospital setting. In my room, only the curtain separating me from my co-detainee was vaguely yellow-orange. The rest of my environment remained a rather boring gray.

*Result of the first plasma exchanges (Artist's view)*

Then came back the blue. Or rather, *the* blues, because all the blues came back at once, but perceived with the same hue.

Let me explain.

Imagine yourself in Greece, in Santorini. At your feet, the sea (*navy blue*). In the distance, the sky (*sky blue*). And all around you, a magnificent canopy of *Cycladic royal blue* roofs -- which, you surely know, is obtained by the subtle blend of a bright blue and a hint of black[^5]. Well, at this stage of my recovery, I perceived all these variations under the same garish and saturated hue -- and blurry of course, that didn’t change.

*Santorini. Left: normal vision. Right: blurred saturated vision (you have to like blue).*

And besides that?

Visual acuity: around 3/10. I was no longer blind nor even visually impaired since only visual acuity determines the degree of disability[^6].

Body Mass Index: very much higher than decency and my wife allow me to reveal publicly but very much lower than what could have earned me an excursion to the CHUV Obesity Center[^7].

After a few days under observation, I was finally able to leave the hospital, arms raised in triumph, crossing the joyous hubbub of an admiring crowd who came to celebrate my return to sight and honor medical science, bearer of hopes and promises. Or, more probably, came to do something else entirely; it’s hard to say in retrospect -- I saw blurry and didn’t hear very well.

## Day 21: Hospital Discharge

[^1]: This experience allowed me to establish a sophistication scale of medical exams that I am quite proud of. At the pinnacle of technological prowess are MRI and other imaging techniques based on the laws of electromagnetism, masterpieces of human genius. In the middle of my scale are blood tests, lumbar punctures, and other procedures that require both a needle and biological analyses. At the bottom of the scale, finally, but still used with a frequency unworthy of the rusticity of the procedure, are the hammer blows to the kneecaps. What gets you a prison sentence in the civilian world covers you with glory, a white coat, and the title of neurologist in a hospital setting. Go figure.
[^2]: Ailments which, you will say, affect the computer scientist that I am less severely than the biathlete I had little chance of becoming anyway. True, but still.
[^3]: Asking a patient to *watch* tennis on TV is conceivable. Asking him to *listen* to tennis on TV, however, when the patient is blind, should be banned by the Geneva Convention. If I had to retain one moment of distress among those I have gone through since losing my vision, it would be listening to a televised tennis match. The commentators assume, rightly, that viewers see the rallies, the scoreboards, and the various statistics displayed on the screen. So they just mumble banalities like "nice point" here and "break point" there, without specifying who scored the point or made the break. So I spent about twenty hours spread over five days, listening to ball hits, dull commentary, and polite applause without knowing who was playing or who was winning.

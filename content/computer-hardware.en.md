## Screen
To replace two aging 14" "flat" screens with poor contrast and black depth, I was looking for a single screen with the following specs:
* VA panel[^1] [[guide](https://www.rtings.com/monitor/learn/ips-vs-va-vs-tn)]
* static contrast of 2500:1 or more [[guide](https://www.makeuseof.com/hdr-screen-specs-to-look-for/)]
* curved
* about 34"

After reading some online comparisons, I restricted my selection to:
* the [Huawei Mateview GT 34"](https://consumer.huawei.com/en/monitors/mateview-gt/specs/)
   * brightness: 350 cd/m²
   * static contrast: 4000:1
   * resolution: 3440 x 1440
* the [Samsung Odyssey G5 32"](https://www.samsung.com/uk/monitors/gaming/odyssey-g5-g55a-32-inch-165hz-1ms-ls32ag550euxxu/#specs).
   * brightness: 300 cd/m²
   * static contrast: 2500:1
   * resolution: 2560 x 1440

The final decision, in favor of the Huawei, was based on contrast, resolution and the opportunity to get it while on sale.

## Keyboard
Now working in a relatively dark environment, I made the choice to change the good old [rustic Dell keyboard](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01E7V73IE) to which I was used for a backlit keyboard . The criteria considered were:
* US QWERTY layout with numeric keypad, out of habit,
* type [membrane](https://www.dareu.com/fresh/newlaunch/the-ultimate-guide-to-membrane-keyboard/) to limit noise,
* lighting "through" the keys and not just "around" the keys,
* sober look

Of the brands I've used over the years, Logitech and Steelseries had the best options. My choice finally fell on the [Steelseries Apex 3](https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-3) whose only fault is lighting "around the keys" which is too intense for my taste compared to lighting "through" the keys. I haven't found keyboards that only have "through" lighting, no "around" lighting.

Note: there are also non-lighting keyboards with keys specially designed to provide high contrast:

[^1]: Although OLED Monitors offer the best contrast and depth of black, by far, they were still way above my budget at the time of the decision.

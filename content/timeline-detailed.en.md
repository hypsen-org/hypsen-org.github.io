## Introduction
In May 2023, I lost my vision due to an autoimmune reaction.

In May 2024, I had almost entirely recovered my visual abilities.

The timeline below details these 12 months.

## May 2023
- D-5:
    - I was diagnosed with pneumonia (transmitted by one of my children).
    - It was not known at the time, but in reaction to this pneumonia, the immune system went haywire and attacked the central nervous system. This was the start of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis ([ADEM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acute_disseminated_encephalomyelitis)).
- D-Day: 
    - Loss of vision: upon waking up, objects were extremely blurry.
    - Admitted to the local hospital emergency room[^0].
    - Tests and administration of intravenous anti-inflammatories.
    - By evening, the loss of vision was total. Visual acuity below 1/10 in each eye.
    - The slightest light dazzled me. People imagine the blind see only black; I saw (almost) only white.
- D+3 (approximately): 
    - Visual acuity slightly improved, to 1/10 in each eye.
    - Colors disappeared. Vision only in shades of gray (or rather: in shades of white).
- D+7 (approximately):
    - ADEM diagnosis confirmed: tests showed lesions in the brain and optic nerve. The medical team's prompt response saved me from the worst[^1].
- D+8 to D+18:
    - Treatment by [plasmapheresis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasmapheresis) to purge the antibodies causing the lesions.
    - Dazzling light persisted but vision and colors gradually returned.
- D+19:
    - End of hospitalization.
    - Acuity: 3/10 in each eye.
    - Persistent dazzling.
    - Yellow and orange perception returned.

## June and July 2023
- Adapted to a life with "low vision". My visual acuity kept improving very slowly.
- An occupational therapist visited to help adapt my home.
- Indoors and outdoors, I constantly wore [category 4](../adaptation/sunglasses/#category-4) sunglasses to limit dazzling.
- Accompanied, I could walk on the street and shop with the help of store employees.
- An examination at the ophthalmic hospital[^2] confirmed that the dazzling could be caused by lesions on the optic nerve. Essentially, the optic nerve sends a distorted signal to the brain, exaggerating brightness.

## August 2023
- My visual acuity rapidly improved.
- However, I was still dazzled by the slightest light.
- I asked my wife to take our children on vacation, as we did every year. My goal was that by their return, I would no longer need to wear sunglasses at home.
- To achieve this, I only wore my regular glasses[^3]. Instead of "protecting" my brain by making it believe the light was low (with sunglasses), I let it deal with my regular glasses and the excess light sent by the optic nerve. I gambled that my brain would reconfigure and correct itself.
- The experiment "hurt my eyes," but by late August, the gamble paid off. I could move, cook, and play with the kids without sunglasses.
- However, I still couldn't watch TV or read black text on white (letters, printed books, most websites).

## September to November 2023
- As I work in IT, I tackled configuring my computer[^4], both hardware and software. I took the opportunity to learn to modify elements I had previously ignored[^5].
- Inspired, I began writing this site, dedicated to light hypersensitivity.
- By mid-September, I felt an unusual type of fatigue. My morale was excellent and my body in shape, but I still needed to sleep several hours during the day. A doctor explained it was probably neurological fatigue, common in patients with neurological lesions. Medication treatment began.
- I regained 10/10 visual acuity in each eye.
- Only light hypersensitivity prevented me from reading black text on white.

## December 2023 and January 2024
- I finally resumed reading the paperback I had left in May. It hurt my eyes, but I read about 1200 pages in 1 month.
- Morale was at its highest. I believed my light hypersensitivity was receding and I only had to overcome chronic fatigue.

## February to May 2024
- I could no longer read printed books. While my light hypersensitivity was receding, it wasn't enough for prolonged reading of black text on white. Discussing with a doctor, I assumed I read 1200 pages in December despite eye fatigue due to excitement. Unfortunately, after the excitement, only eye fatigue and the inability to read normally remained.
- That said, I could read comfortably in dark mode[^6] on my e-reader. I also configured every detail of my computer to be in dark mode as well.
- Finally, now that my hypersensitivity was relatively stable, I had glasses made with tinted lenses to reduce dazzling. These glasses didn't mask my eyes like sunglasses, which was more pleasant for those around me, and they allowed me to read printed books comfortably.
- I thus considered having regained 95% of my visual abilities in general and my ability to consume content specifically[^7].

## Since May 2024
- The last battle is against neurological fatigue. It doesn't really belong on this site dedicated to light hypersensitivity; I will end the timeline here.

I hope this timeline, like the rest of the site, will be useful to others.
